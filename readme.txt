P2 Integration with Mandigo Theme
-----
- Make sure you have the site layout set to 1024px or P2 templates will look deformed
- Set the post color to #fff for best effects.
- Move the files from this archive to the Mandigo theme folder
- Remove js/jquery.js from the js folder. This file will conflict with P2 functionality.
